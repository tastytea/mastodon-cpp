# How to contribute

## Reporting bugs or suggesting enhancements

Before reporting a bug , please
[perform a search](https://github.com/tastytea/mastodon-cpp/issues?q=is%3Aissue)
to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has, add a comment to the
existing issue instead of opening a new one. Same for enhancements.

You can also contact me via the Fediverse if you don't have a GitHub-account.
My account is [@tastytea@soc.ialis.me](https://soc.ialis.me/@tastytea).

## Pull requests

Please use similar coding conventions as the rest of the project. The basic rule
to remember is to write code in the same style as the existing/surrounding code.
