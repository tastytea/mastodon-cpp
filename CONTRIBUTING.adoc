== How to contribute

Read the link:CODE_OF_CONDUCT.adoc[Code of Conduct].

=== Reporting bugs or suggesting enhancements

Before reporting a bug, please
https://schlomp.space/tastytea/{project}/issues[perform a search] to see if the
problem has already been reported. If it has, add a comment to the existing
issue instead of opening a new one. Same for enhancements.

You can also contact me via mailto:tastytea@tastytea.de[E-Mail],
link:xmpp:tastytea@tastytea.de[XMPP] or the
https://likeable.space/users/tastytea[Fediverse] if you don't want to open an
account.

=== Pull requests

Please use similar coding conventions as the rest of the project. The basic rule
to remember is to write code in the same style as the existing/surrounding code.

You can also send me your patches via email, to {patch_contact} (ideally using
`git format-patch` or `git send-email`).
