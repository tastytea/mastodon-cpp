== How to contribute

Read the link:{uri-coc}[Code of Conduct].

=== Reporting bugs or suggesting enhancements

Before reporting a bug, please
https://schlomp.space/tastytea/{project}/issues[perform a search] to see if the
problem has already been reported. If it has, add a comment to the existing
issue instead of opening a new one. Same for enhancements.

You can also contact me via mailto:{contact-email}[E-Mail],
link:xmpp:{contact-xmpp}[XMPP] or the {contact-fediverse}[Fediverse] if you
don't want to open an account.

=== Pull requests

Please use similar coding conventions as the rest of the project. The basic rule
to remember is to write code in the same style as the existing/surrounding code.

You can also send me your patches via mailto:{contact-email}[E-Mail], ideally
using `git format-patch` or `git send-email`.
